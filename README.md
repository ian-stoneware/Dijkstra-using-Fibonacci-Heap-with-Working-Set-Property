# Dijkstra using Fibonacci Heap with Working Set Property

## Description
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It includes both the naive approach, an optimized version using a Fibonacci heap and another optimized version using a Fibonacci heap with Working Set Property.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ian-stoneware/Dijkstra-using-Fibonacci-Heap-with-Working-Set-Property.git
   
   cd dijkstra-algorithm
   
2. Run main.py to get the time comsuming comparison:
   ```bash
   python main.py

4. Run animation.py to get the animation of how a Dijkstra Algorithm to get the shortest path:
   ```bash
   python animation.py

6. Run visual.py to get the result of how a Dijkstra Algorithm to get the shortest path:
   ```bash
   python visual.py
